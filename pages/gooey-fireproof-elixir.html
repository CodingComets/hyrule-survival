    <p>
        I hope the sound of spontaneous combustion scared you enough to enlighten yourself in
        the ways of the wilds. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's an old reliable drink common among the folk of the foothill stable
        in the vicinity of Death mountain. It involves a type of lizard endemic to the region and
        an assortment of monster parts.
    </p>

    <p>
        Normally. the recipe calls for a single Fireproof lizard and any monster part but we can do
        <em>far better.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Personally, I enjoy the taste of Red Chu jelly in tandem with a single lizalfos tails and two complete
        Fireproof lizards for enhanced potency. Naysayers will dissaprove and claim that only additional
        servings of lizards will increase the effects.
    </p>

    <p>
        While they may be right, why not treat yourself with a flavorful concoction with carefully
        balanced flavors? You may live in the wild, but the wilds need not live in you!
    </p>

    <h4> Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2 servings of Fireproof lizards</li>
        <li> 2 servings of Red chu jelly</li>
        <li> A single lizalfos tail</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Preparation:</h4>

    <p> Slow cook on a bowl under a bonfire. Make sure to add the lizards, the jelly and the tail (or let pickle in bottle 
        for added flavor).</p>
    <p> Once boiling, pour content into a bottle. Enjoy your new found protection against the heat!</p>
